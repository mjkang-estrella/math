# Research rules

Scope: this directory only. Accept theorems in the pinned OpenAI math repository as true, as the user explicitly requests. Validate every new deduction independently; do not audit upstream truth.

- Read sources/upstream.json for the immutable revision and sources/CONTENTS.md for the manuscript catalogue. sources/preprints-tree.json is the complete preprint path listing. sources/tree.json is an ignored, TRUNCATED root-tree retrieval cache (GitHub limits); use preprints-tree.json for manuscript paths.
- State exact hypotheses, quantifiers, source dependencies, proof, validation, and novelty limits for every proposed result.
- Read actual manuscript theorem statements before relying on catalogue summaries. Check companion papers for duplicate corollaries.
- Distinguish a new-to-this-project corollary from a demonstrated new-to-literature theorem. Numerical evidence is not a proof.
- Assigned agents write only their uniquely assigned proposal/review/experiment files. Do not edit shared indexes, stage files, commit, or change other projects. The parent integrates and commits each finding separately.
- Do not start further agents unless your task specifically requests them.
- Use pinned raw GitHub URLs when retrieving source files; record paths and theorem labels.
